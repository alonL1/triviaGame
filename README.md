# 🧠 Trivia Showdown

A multiplayer trivia game where two players compete head-to-head answering questions generated by AI. Players use different keyboard controls (WASD vs Arrow keys) in a Kahoot-style format with timed questions.

## ✨ Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Player 1 uses WASD, Player 2 uses Arrow keys
- **AI-Generated Questions**: Questions are generated based on any topic you choose
- **Timed Questions**: 15-second timer for each question with visual countdown
- **Real-time Scoring**: Track scores for both players throughout the game
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Flexible Topics**: Enter any topic and get relevant trivia questions
- **Fallback System**: Works even when API is unavailable

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Choose a Topic**: Enter any topic you'd like to be quizzed on (e.g., "Science", "Movies", "History")
2. **Start the Game**: Click "Start Game" to begin generating questions
3. **Answer Questions**: When questions appear, players select answers using their assigned keys:
   - **Player 1**: W (top), A (left), S (bottom), D (right)
   - **Player 2**: ↑ (top), ← (left), ↓ (bottom), → (right)
4. **Beat the Timer**: You have 15 seconds per question to make your selection
5. **See Results**: After 5 questions, see who won and play again!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: With Node.js Server (Recommended)

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open Your Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Static Files Only

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. The game will work with fallback questions when the API server isn't running.

### File Structure

├── index.html          # Main game interface
├── style.css          # Styling and animations

### Key Components

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: Express.js server for API integration
- **AI Integration**: Ready for LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🔧 API Integration

The game is designed to integrate with LLM APIs for question generation. Currently uses mock data, but can be easily connected to:

- OpenAI GPT API
- Anthropic Claude API
- Google Gemini API
- Any other text generation API

To integrate a real LLM API:

1. Add your API key to environment variables
2. Uncomment and modify the `generateQuestionsWithLLM` function in `api-server.js`
3. Install additional dependencies as needed (e.g., `openai` package)

### Example OpenAI Integration

```javascript
// In api-server.js, replace the mock function with:
const OpenAI = require('openai');
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

async function generateQuestionsWithLLM(topic) {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [{
            role: "user",
            content: `Generate 5 trivia questions about ${topic}...`
        }]
    });
    // Parse and return questions
}
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
- Modify `style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- The design uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Custom CSS animations for smooth transitions

### Game Settings
- Change timer duration in `script.js` (currently 15 seconds)
- Modify number of questions per game
- Adjust scoring system
- Add sound effects or music

### Controls
- Key bindings are defined in the `bindKeyboardEvents()` method
- Easy to modify or add additional control schemes
